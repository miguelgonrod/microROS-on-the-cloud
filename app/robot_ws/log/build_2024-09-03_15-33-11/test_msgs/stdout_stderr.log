[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findtest_interface_files.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "test_interface_files", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "test_interface_files" with any of the following names:

    test_interface_filesConfig.cmake
    test_interface_files-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "test_interface_files" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "test_interface_files_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "test_interface_files" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
